# ORG

Org is my futile attempt to organize myself, lest I go insane.

### Idea

I want to create a comprehensive organization tool, inspired by orgmode and various other project management tools. None of them are quite right for me, so the logical conclusion is to great my own, using Python/Django and integrating the use of Sublime and other tools.

### Sublime

I've created my own snippets for the orgmode-plugin:

- Turn page-titles into Markdown headlines and titlelines
- Create GFM-style tables and add new rows
- Create a metadata header for the Evernote plugin
- Code tags for Markdown
- Create an extrenal link list with internal links
